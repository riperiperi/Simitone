Alternative C# Windows Frontend for The Sims 1, based off of FreeSO. http://freeso.org 
(***REQUIRES*** a legitimate copy of The Sims: Complete Collection)

Currently does not support saving, build/buy, the entire Fame career track and a few other important things.

*Only for Desktop Windows.* Other platforms cannot be supported.

# Purpose

On modern operating systems, The Sims has a few nagging issues that make it less than playable. Simitone can be seen as a tool to improve the playability of your existing installation of The Sims. Here are some features:

- Custom user interface that works at modern resolutions.
- Improved graphical performance, support for high resolutions and refresh rates.
- Additional lighting effects.
- *Volcanic*, a program which allows you to examine, modify and create new game objects. (from FreeSO)

# Why is it called Simitone?

Simitone -> Semitone -> musical term -> C# -> a note

Further questions can be directed at my PR manager, uh, ... burglar cop.
